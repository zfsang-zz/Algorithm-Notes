    "## TF-IDF\n",
    "TF-IDF, which stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, is a method for featurizing text which takes into account both word frequency within a single document, as well as the frequency of that word across all documents in a corpus. The purpose is to weight infrequent 'specialty' words more heavily than common words, since those specialty words tend to give us more information about the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Words that appear in only a few documents give us a lot of information about the type of document it came from. \n",
    "#### This is a typical text featurization pipeline:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Tokenization ----> Stop Word Removal ----> Stemming/Lemmatization ----> Bag of words/TFIDF   \n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Tokenization\n",
    "As with preparing text for Naive Bayes, our pipeline starts by tokenizing the corpus into a list of list of strings. At this point, we should also make decisions about capitalization, punctuation, and whether to account for sentence and paragraph boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stop Words\n",
    "An ongoing theme in machine learning is that features that do not give a lot of information should be excluded or penalized. In NLP, the first step in reducing our feature-space is to remove stop words--words that appear frequently across many documents and across many topics. They're words that don't help us narrow down a document's unique qualities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stemming and lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stemming is a more crude technique that follows a set of rules for removing things like plurals, verb endings, and adjectivizations in order to condense many related words down to a single token. It will only ever remove or modify the ends of words, and a lot of the tokens it outputs are not actual words. Here is an example of a word passing through through the Porter Stemmer algorithm.\n",
    "```\n",
    "realizations --> realization --> realizate --> realiz\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Lemmatizers, on the other hand, have been trained to examine the morphology of each word, to determine its function in the sentence and modify it appropriately. A lemmatizer will generally output a larger feature set than a stemmer. In this case, lemmatizing 'realizations' yields 'realization'--not much of a change when compared to 'realiz'!"
